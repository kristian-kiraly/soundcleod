## 1.0.0 (September 30, 2016)

SoundCleod was completely rewritten from scratch.

This new version uses the [Electron framework](http://electron.atom.io/) which
not only contains the latest cutting-edge Chrome version (hopefully solving all
playback problems) but also enables much easier development in the future.

This release fixes the following issues:

- Playback gets stuck frequently #107
- Sign in with Facebook does not work #109
- Sign in with Google does no work #53

The minimum supported macOS version changes from 10.7 (Lion) to 10.9 (Mavericks).

Some features were temporarily removed from SoundCleod to make this release
happen quickly. They will hopefully added back some time in the near future:

- The automatic updater no longer has any user interface, it downloads and
  installs new versions without prompting (on application restart)
- Dock menu controls were removed
- The "Edit URL" dialog (Cmd+L) was removed
- Microphone button controls were removed
- Space bar play/pause control only works if SoundCleod is in foreground
