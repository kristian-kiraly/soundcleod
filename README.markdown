## What is SoundCleod?

SoundCleod is a desktop application which brings
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) to macOS and Windows without using a web
browser.

Why is that good?

- No more 'trying to find in which tab is SoundCloud running'..
- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)
- Stops on suspend.

SoundCleod is a weird name. [How to pronounce it?](https://soundcloud.com/senart/soundcleod)
